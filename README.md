# roblox-livechat
A live chat script for Roblox exploiting,

# THIS ONLY SUPPORTS EXECUTORS WITH WEBSOCKET LIBRARY!

A very simple concept of live chat for Roblox, like in neverlose. 
Of course, this has many security issues and stuff like that cause I didn't spend much time on it, this is just a concept.

# Server
To run the server, you will need node.js (I had version v18.16.0 of Node installed when I made this.)

to run, use: 
`node server.js`
in the terminal window. This will start the websocket.
